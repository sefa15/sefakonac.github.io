<h1>Leonard Adleman</h1>
<p>
 Leonard Max Adleman was born on December 31 1945, San Francisco, California USA. He is an American computer scientist and molecular biologist. He is now professor at the University of Southern  California . He is known for being deviser of the  RSA ( Security applications, including https.)  and of  DNA computing.<a href="#leonard">[1]</a></p>

<h2>Leonard Adleman's Academic Life</h2>
<p>Leonard Max Adleman was born San Francisco in 1945. He attended the University of California, Berkeley, where he received his BA degree in mathematics in 1968 and his Ph.D. degree in Electric Engineering Computer Science in 1976. Leonard Adleman name was announced as the first in his project (RSA) he did with two friends (American computer scientist Ronald L. Rivest and Israeli cryptographer Adi Shamir.)<a href="#leonard1">[2]</a> Cryptographic Communication System and Method ( known as RSA encryption) is inventive appendage for making public key cryptography useful in practice.<a href="leonard2">[3]</a> Through this project, they have won the Turing Award with the highest honors.
  His second best achievement is working on DNA computing. In 2002, he and his research group managed to solve a nontrivial problem using DNA computation.


    <p>Other achievements are;</p>
<p>*Adleman was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 2006</p>
<p>*He is one of the original discoverers of the Adleman-Pomerance-Rumely primality test.</p>
<p>*He was also the mathematical consultant on the movie Sneakers.</p>
<p>*He is also widely referred to as the Father of DNA computing. He is a member of the National Academy of Sciences.</p>
<p>*Currently, Adleman is working on the mathematical theory of Strata.<a href="4. Book of Members, 1780-2010: Chapter A (PDF). Academy of Arts  and Sciences. Retrieved 6 April.">[4]</a> </p>
